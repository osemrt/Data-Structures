# Binary search trees

A  **binary search tree**  (**BST**) is a special kind of binary tree. A binary search tree is a tree that is structurally a binary tree, and stores data in its nodes very efficiently. It provides very fast search operations, and other operations such as insertion and deletion are also very easy and convenient.

A binary tree is called a binary search tree if the value at any node in the tree is greater than the values in all the nodes of its left sub-tree, and less than or equal to the values of all the nodes of the right sub-tree. For example, if **K1**,  **K2**, and  **K3**  are key values in a tree of three nodes, then it should satisfy the following conditions:

1.  The key values of  _K2<=K1_
2.  The key values  _K3>K1_
